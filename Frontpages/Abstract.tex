    Many complex computer vision problems have now become approachable with the advancements in the area of deep learning. Generative neural network frameworks have been one of the most recent developments in this field. These networks have shown promising results in generating real world synthetic images of bedrooms, cats, human faces etc. These frameworks are being applied to various computer vision applications and one such challenging problem is generating images. In this work, we scrutinize various generative frameworks such as Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), InfoGAN, etc. We then train an improved generative network conditioned on some desired feature to generate a fake image.
