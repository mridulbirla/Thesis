    any complex computer vision problems have now become approachable with the advancements in the areas of deep learning. Generative neural network frameworks have been one of the most recent developments in this field. These networks have shown promising results of generating real world synthetic images such as of bedrooms, cats, human faces etc. These frameworks are being applied to various computer vision applications and once such challenging problem is generating images. In this work, we scrutinize various generative frameworks such as Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN), Stacked Generative Adversarial Network(SGAN), InfoGAN. We then, train the combined network, over the CHAR-RNN-CNN network encoded caption/label combined with image. To evaluate the performance of the network, we test the newly generated images over the InceptionNet to see classification accuracy of these images.
