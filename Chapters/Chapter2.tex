In this chapter, we look at the previous work done in the field of generative models. Here first we look at diffeerent generative model. As our work is focused on genrative adversarial neural network, we look at the various models under the umbrella of it. %There has been lot of research going on in area of generative models.One of the most proven models belongs to Restricted boltzzman machine and Deep Belief Net[cite]. The Genrative adverserial Networks[cite] are the newest model to join the family.
