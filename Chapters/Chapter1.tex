\chap{Introduction}

Deep learning has been one the major area of development in the field of Artificial Intelligence. It has paved way for many abstruse problem in the field of computer science specifically computer vision and natural language processing. Convolution neural network have become so powerful that they been able to classify images better than human. These networks at granular level have neurons which have been studied and visualized. It has shown that they are capable of learning specific image feature. In this work, we look at Generative adversarial neural network which are on step further advancement in this field. The standard neural network have shown excellent capability in classification task but they require supervised learning and large amount of labeled data. But sometime getting these huge data require lot of human effort and money. This work tries to reduce this by developing generative model which are capable of generating labeled data. These model falls under the category of unsupervised learning.
